# refactor-assignment

##Description

- Why complete this project? This was an assigned project for the DU coding bootcamp.
- What was the goal? The goal was to take some unorganized and sloppy but functional html and css code and clean it up.
  The original html did not use any semantic elements and only "divs" so that was corrected as well as some linking with the navbar.
  The original css had many duplicate items and was very unorganized. cleaned up the duplicates and organized by specificity.
- What did you learn? Learned a lot about how to cleanup the css since I frequently create a new class for each change.
